# OpenAI Agents: A Practical Guide - Resources

This repository contains supplementary materials for OpenAI's paper, *[A Practical Guide to Building Agents](https://cdn.openai.com/business-guides-and-resources/a-practical-guide-to-building-agents.pdf)*, along with tools to help digest its contents.

## What's Included
- ðŸ“„ **Original Paper** (`a-practical-guide-to-building-agents.pdf`) â€“ OpenAI's 34-page guide on AI agent design.
- ðŸŽ§ **Audio Overview** (`agents-overview.mp3`) â€“ A conversational summary generated by [Google's NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com), ideal for passive listening.
- ðŸ“Š **Diagram** (`agents-diagram.png`) â€“ Visual breakdown of agent architectures (credit: [Lewis Walker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lewiswalkerai/)).

## Why These Resources?
Research papers can be dense. Instead of just reading (or asking ChatGPT for a summary), I used NotebookLM to:
1. Transform the paper into a **dialog-style discussion** for deeper understanding.
2. Generate an **audio overview**â€”perfect for listening during commutes.
3. Build a searchable library of key AI/ML papers in audio format.

## Suggested Use
- **Quick grasp**: Listen to the audio overview first (~15-30 mins).
- **Deep dive**: Read the paper with the diagram as reference.
- **Hybrid approach**: Combine both for efficient learning.
